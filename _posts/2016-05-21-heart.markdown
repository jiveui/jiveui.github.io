Throughout this tutorial, we'll walk you through the creation of a basic Jive application with a bit of animation.

Here is the video demonstration how our app will work.

If you don't like to read you can download it from [jive-examples github repository](https://github.com/jiveui/jive-examples) and run it.

If it's not enough let's go together.

#### Project structure

A Jive project is an [OpenFL](http://openfl.org) and [Haxe](http://haxe.org) project. So it must have a main class and project.xml as a project file.

- [OpenFl project description](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/getting-started/your-first-project/);
- [project.xml documentation](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/projects/project-files/xml-format/).

Jive is based on:

the [Model - View - ViewModel idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel).

> MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface (a markup language or GUI code)
> from development of the business logic (the data model).
> The view model of MVVM is a value converter; meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting)
> the data objects from the model in such a way objects are easily managed and presented.
>
> In this respect, the view model is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic.

and [the Data Binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UI_data_binding). It's a way to implement a link between views and view models.


##### View

##### View Model

#### SVG as a graphics definition

#### Actuate to animate
