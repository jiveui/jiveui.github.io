This project facilitates communication between the people and the company that maintains their apartaments.

The first page provides us with the most important information like account info, billing to be paid, and r
esource consumption like water or electricity. Also on this form we put some important navigation buttons,
a button to pay your balance and a history button. This is a lot of information so we integrated a few
interactive elements to hide and show this information when it’s necessary.

The next page is specifically for all user consumption where we can choose the resource type and review it
with a table or a chart. This table can contain a lot of information and still work pretty fast.
This information is presented with a visual chart  so we can see how our consumptions are changing with each period.
And we can see some point values if we touch it on the chart. Also, we can pick time intervals and time periods for
the table and the chart.
We have another tab with a ticket system when the user can send messages to the maintenance company regarding
issues or problems they may have.

And a left menu component that contains some additional information. You can see here some interactive elements too,
in order to reduce the amount of visible information at the same time. Lastly, I’ll demonstrate how our text
fields works for iOS in account info form. Today all editable text areas are native so they support all features.
